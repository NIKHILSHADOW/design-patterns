# DECORATOR

## Contents

### Introduction

It says **Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators
provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.**

Suppose if we need multiple responsibilities at a time, depending on requirement, then we shouldn't tie behaviour to hierarchy.

### STEPS

1. create base interface
2. implement concrete classes of base interface
3. create abstract decorator class extending base class and also having base class instance
4. implement decorator classes

### CODE
